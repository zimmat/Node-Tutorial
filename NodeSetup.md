# Setup Node JS

## Installing Node

On Ubuntu you can install Node JS from the command line using `apt-get`.

You should already have it installed on your laptop if you completed the codeX intro.

The installation instructions are as follows:

* `sudo apt-get install node-legacy`
* `sudo apt-get install npm`

Open a terminal window:

* type `nodejs` and press enter - you should now be in a Node JS console - you should get no errors. (on a non Ubuntu machine the command is called `node`). Use ctrl-C to get out of it
* type `npm` you should see some information about npm on the console

Now you are ready to use JavaScript from the command line.

## Node JS Javascript from the command line

Let's run a simple JavaScript script from the command line:

* Create a file called `hello.js`
* copy this text into the file: 'console.log('hello world!');'
* Save the file
* now run it using `nodejs hello.js`
* what happens?

So what just happend? You liberated your JavaScript knowledge from the command line.

Now prove this to yourself and write some JavaScript that uses:

* an `if` statement
* a `for` loop
* a simple function
* what else you need to get comfortable

If you can, create about 5 different JavaScript (.js) files to get more comfortable with JavaScript on the command line.

You can run the scripts using `nodejs filename.js`
