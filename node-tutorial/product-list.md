## Product list

Create a module that can read a product file and do two things:

* return a unique list of products in the file
* return the total number of items sold for each product

The module should:

* be called `products.js`
* have two ***Asynchronous*** methods:
  * `productNames` - returns a list of products
  * `productsSold` - returns a map of how many of each product is sold - mapping productName to quantity sold.
* use the `./files/products.csv` file to test

**Once all the tests are passing you are done!**
